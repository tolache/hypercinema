                    <h1 class="review__summary">A genre-breaking classic</h1>
                    <p class="review__text">
                        There can be little doubt that Cloud Atlas will become a classic
                        that will be watched over and over again by its devoted followers,
                        just like its predecessors by Stanley Kubrick and Ridley Scott.
                        Despite the many questions I had in my mind when I left the theater
                        and the moments during the film when I felt disappointed or confused,
                        I knew this, and I have not stopped thinking about the movie
                        and longing to be back in front of the screen.
                        <br><br>
                        It is easy to criticize this movie
                        as some have done for being overly ambitious,
                        pandering to low taste, being too simple or too complex,
                        with too few actors or too many,
                        or even for celebrating revenge violence against professional critics
                        who write negative reviews.
                        They may all be correct,
                        but these critics will still put themselves in the same category
                        as those that warned audiences against 2001 or Blade Runner.
                        The truth is that Cloud Atlas is profound in its reach,
                        its visual and acoustic impact,
                        its mesmerizing flow and its completely ground-breaking storytelling,
                        and movie goers will see it and feel it in their guts.
                        <br><br>
                        It is a movie that is a product of our age of internet-driven
                        universal knowledge and vision,
                        and the freedom we have to travel the world
                        and jump between ages, genres, images and identities at our will.
                        It reminds us that we are human
                        and that we can still hear our heart beat, if we listen.

                    <h1 class="review__summary">A Pretentious Cliché</h1>
                    <p class="review__text">
                        Now... forgive my hateful language
                        but I am still recovering from the ridiculous boredom and anger
                        that I experienced last night.
                        I should start by saying
                        that I spent the night trying to think of
                        something good about this movie. I failed.
                        <br><br>
                        This was the most pretentious,
                        most cliché film I have seen in a long long time.
                        This idea with telling different stories serving a single purpose
                        which would "form the big picture" is so overused.
                        And it might have worked with some other films
                        but in this case it's just "oh c'mon, seriously?!".
                        The cast is awful. Don't get me wrong I usually like Tom Hanks
                        and I loved Ben Whishaw in The Perfume,
                        but the acting in Cloud Atlas is literally scandalous.
                        Now about the movie itself.
                        It is crystal clear what they tried to achieve.
                        It should have been some sort of a revelation which would explain life itself.
                        In reality it is simple, shallow and ridiculous.
                        It doesn't raise questions or make you think. I
                        t doesn't even try to show you the answers.
                        It just tells you stuff with a dramatic slow preacher-like voice
                        and wannabe interesting accents.
                        Honestly this parody of a movie felt as if you caught
                        a sub- sub-sub-cable 22h lame melodramatic TV show crew,
                        you gave them a giant budget and a camera (and Halle Berry for publicity)
                        and they took the opportunity to spill every single stupid,
                        random and clichéd thought into a three hour nightmare.

                    <h1 class="review__summary">A Powerful Spectacle</h1>
                    <p class="review__text">
                        I didn't find it to be a mess at all, and it was certainly
                        the best thing the Wachowskis have ever done.
                        I'm not sure how the directing duties were distributed,
                        so I'll uniformly praise Tom Tykwer as well.
                        <br><br>
                        I haven't read the book, so I can't make any comparisons there,
                        but I don't often leave a film adaptation wanting to read the novel afterwards,
                        as I did after seeing this.
                        <br><br>
                        Visually stunning, epic in scope, a strong score;
                        the sort of film that you're constantly amazed was ever made and happy it was.
                        Equal parts comedy, romance, thriller, and dystopian speculative fiction,
                        it really is an astounding mix of disparate elements.
                        <br><br>
                        The biggest overall failure was definitely some of the make-up effects
                        - trying to turn Doona Bae into a believable red-headed Caucasian woman
                        was simply distracting - but the overall art & sound design was incredible.
                        <br><br>
                        If I could turn channels while watching TV and switch between stories
                        and narratives as seamlessly and as deftly as the editing in Cloud Atlas,
                        it would honestly be hard to go back to simply watching one show at a time.
                        <br><br>
                        Truly a marvel of multitasking on so many levels. Great stuff.
